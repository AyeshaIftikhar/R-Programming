# 3.1 Instrinstic attributes: mode and length
R operates on objects(entities to work with).

## Mode

* Vectors of numeric. complex or logical values are known as __Atomic__ structures since their components are all of the same type/mode. 
  * Vectors must have their values of _same mode_. 
  * A vector can be empty and still have a mode at same time.
  
* R also operates on __lists__. which will belongs to mode __lists__. These are ordered sequence of objects which individually can be of any mode. Lists are known as __recursive__ rather than atomic structures since their components can themselves be lists in their own space.

Other recursive structure are those of mode __functions__ and __expressions__. 

When we talked about mode of an object, we are talking about the basic type of its fundamental constituents.This is the special case of a property of object.

## Length
Length is the number of elements that is present in an object, or we can say that number of elements that are stored against an object.

* The length and mode of an object can be found by using the following functions:
```{}
  mode(object_name) # return the mode of an object
  length(object_name) # returns length of an object

```

* We can also find other attributes of an object by using following function:
```{}
  attributes(object_name) # it will return attributes of an object if any
```

## Changing mode of an object
We can change the mode of any object if needed to do so, Like
```{r}
# R caters for change of mode
x <- 0:9 
x #[1] 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
# as.character()/ as.type() will change the mode
digits <- as.character(x)
digits # [1] "0" "1" "2" "3" "4" "5" "6" "7" "8" "9"
# further coercion/change of mode
d <- as.integer(digits)
d #[1] 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
There is a collection of functions of the form __as.something()__ for either coercion from one mode to other, or for investing properties of one object to other.

# 3.2 Changing Length of an Object

An empty object may still have a mode. Let's just say
```{r}
e <- numeric() # creates a numric empty vector
e
# can make empty vector of any type 
```
When an object is created the new components can be added to it. By simply added the index value outside its previous range.
```{r}
e[3] <- 17
e
# 1st two values will be empty just because we have assigned one and that one value will be the 3rd one.
```

To truncate the size of an object requires only an assignment to do so.We have an object d of length 10. To make it an object of length 5 consisting of just former components with even index in following way:
```{r}
d <- d[2 * 1:5]
d

```
 We can retain the first 3 values by 
```{r}
length(d) <- 3
d
```
 
# 3.3 Getting and Setting Attriutes
The function __attributes(object_name)__ can be used to get all the non-instrinsic elements of an object.And the function __attr(object, name)__ can be used to select a specific attribute.

# 3.4 Class of an Object
All objects in R always belongs to some class which can be reported by __class__ function. 

* A special attribute _class_ of the object is used to allow for an object-oriented style of programming in class.
* The __unclass__ function is used to remobe the effect on an class from an object.
